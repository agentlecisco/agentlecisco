- 👋 Hi, I’m @agentlecisco and I work in developer relations on the Cisco Developer Experience team. 
     I manage the API documentation going onto developer.cisco.com. Work with us when you want to publish documentation or tutorials about
     Cisco platforms. 

- 🌱 I’m currently working on interactive documentation for OpenAPI specifications as well as in-browser terminal tutorials using Docker 
     containers to set up all the prerequisites for students. 
- 📗👍💻 I wrote the book, [Docs Like Code](https://docslikecode/book/) to describe great techniques for developers and writers to work together
     on excellent documentation using Git as a content and code management system. Once you use continuous integration and continuous 
     deployment to build docs sites, you'll wonder how you ever worked without those systems in your life. It's game-changing!
