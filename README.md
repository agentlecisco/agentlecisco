- 👋 Hi, I’m @agentlecisco and I work on the DevNet team. I am Director at Cisco for API and Developer Experience.  
     My team works on API quality assessments and API documentation with OpenAPI specifications, interactive REST
     API documentation, and developer tutorials. 
- :accessibility:  I'm working towards eliminating biased language in code and content, and Cisco enables that work with the Social Justice Actions Office. 
- 📗👍💻 I wrote the book, [Docs Like Code](https://docslikecode/book/) to describe great techniques for developers and writers to work together
     on excellent documentation using Git as a content and code management system. Once you use continuous integration and continuous 
     deployment to build docs sites, you'll wonder how you ever worked without those systems in your life. It's game-changing!
